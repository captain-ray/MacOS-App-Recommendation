## MacOS Apps I sincerely recommend!

##### [1. SizeUp]([http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/)) 

> SizeUp allows you to quickly resize and position your windows with keyboard shortcuts or a handy menu bar icon.

- Paid app, but can keep using demo.

##### [2. Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/)

>  Divvy is an entirely new way of managing your workspace. It allows you to quickly and efficiently “divvy up” your screen into exact portions.

- Paid app, but can keep using demo. 
- Similar to SizeUp, but provide more choices using grid.
